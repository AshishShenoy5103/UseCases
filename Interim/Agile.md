# ðŸš€ Agile Methodology & Scrum Interview Guide

This document provides a quick reference to the most common Agile and Scrum concepts, interview questions, and Agile vs. Waterfall comparisons. Ideal for developers, testers, and project managers preparing for interviews or onboarding Agile practices.

## âœ… Agile Overview

### 1. What is Agile?
Agile is a software development methodology that emphasizes:
- Iterative and incremental delivery
- Continuous feedback and adaptation
- Customer collaboration
- Quick and flexible response to change

---

### 2. Core Values of Agile (Agile Manifesto)
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

---

## ðŸ”„ Scrum Framework

### 3. What is Scrum?
Scrum is an Agile framework that divides work into **Sprints** (2â€“4 weeks), involving:
- Defined roles
- Regular ceremonies
- Prioritized backlogs

---

### 4. Key Roles in Scrum
- **Product Owner (PO):** Manages and prioritizes the Product Backlog  
- **Scrum Master (SM):** Facilitates Scrum events, removes impediments  
- **Development Team:** Cross-functional team that delivers working software

---

### 5. What is a Sprint?
A Sprint is a **time-boxed iteration (2â€“4 weeks)** during which a potentially shippable product increment is created.

---

### 6. What is Sprint Planning?
At the start of each Sprint:
- Team selects items from the Product Backlog
- Defines the Sprint Goal
- Builds the Sprint Backlog (tasks + commitments)

---

### 7. What is Daily Scrum?
A 15-minute stand-up meeting where team members share:
- What they did yesterday
- What they plan to do today
- Any blockers or issues

---

### 8. What is a Sprint Retrospective?
A meeting at the end of the Sprint to discuss:
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items for next Sprint

---

### 9. What is Definition of Done (DoD)?
A shared checklist for what it means for a feature to be **complete**, e.g.:
- Code written, reviewed, tested, documented, and deployed to staging

---

### 10. How is Progress Tracked?
- **Burndown Charts**
- **Task Boards (To Do, In Progress, Done)**
- **Velocity (story points completed per Sprint)**

---

### 11. What is Velocity?
Velocity is the **average story points completed per Sprint**, useful for:
- Forecasting
- Sprint planning
- Release planning

---

### 12. How are changes handled during a Sprint?
Ideally, changes are avoided. But:
- PO can re-negotiate Sprint scope
- Sprint can be canceled in rare cases

---

### 13. What is a Product Backlog? Who owns it?
A **prioritized list of features, bugs, and tasks**.  
**Owned by:** Product Owner

---

### 14. Scrum vs Kanban (Comparison Table)

| Aspect       | Scrum                            | Kanban                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Iteration    | Time-boxed Sprints                | Continuous flow                |
| Roles        | SM, PO, Dev Team                  | No mandatory roles             |
| Work Model   | Planned per Sprint                | Pull-based                     |
| Metrics      | Velocity, Burndown                | Cycle time, Lead time          |

---

### 15. How is quality ensured in Agile?
- Automated Testing
- CI/CD
- Code Reviews
- Definition of Done (DoD)
- TDD and Pair Programming

---

### 16. Missed Sprint Goal? (Sample Answer)
_"We hit an external API issue which delayed our integration. We re-aligned focus, completed other tasks, and discussed dependency risks during the Retrospective."_

---

### 17. What if a team member isnâ€™t contributing effectively?
_"I would have a 1:1 discussion to understand the issue, offer support, and involve the Scrum Master if necessary to protect team dynamics."_

---

### 18. How do you prioritize backlog items?
Based on:
- Business value
- Customer feedback
- Technical risk
- Dependencies  
Techniques: MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Wonâ€™t)

## ðŸ†š Agile vs Traditional (Waterfall) â€“ Key Differences

| Area                | Waterfall                                 | Agile                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Approach            | Sequential                                 | Iterative & Incremental                     |
| Requirements        | Defined at the start, rarely changed       | Evolve over time, changes welcome           |
| Delivery            | One final release                          | Continuous delivery in increments           |
| Testing             | After development                          | Continuous and integrated                   |
| Collaboration       | Limited post-design                        | Ongoing across all roles                    |
| Change Management   | Difficult after design phase               | Easy via backlog refinement and planning    |
| Best Use Case       | Fixed-scope, low change tolerance          | Dynamic scope, frequent feedback needed     |

### ðŸ“Œ Real-world Examples

**Agile is preferred in:**
- Startups
- Web/mobile app development
- Evolving products

**Waterfall is used in:**
- Government contracts
- Construction
- Aerospace

---

## ðŸ“‚ Bonus Tips

- Tools: Jira, Trello, Azure Boards
- Ceremonies: Planning, Daily Scrum, Review, Retrospective
- Use velocity to guide planning, not as a performance metric
