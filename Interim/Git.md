10. **Which command is used to view commit history?**  
    `git log`

11. **What is Git rebase?**  
    Rebasing moves your branch‚Äôs commits to a new base commit, creating a cleaner and linear history.

12. **What is a merge conflict and how do you resolve it?**  
    A conflict occurs when Git cannot auto-merge changes.  
    - Open the file with conflict  
    - Look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`  
    - Edit the file, keep the correct code  
    - Remove the conflict markers  
    - Run `git add` and `git commit`

13. **What is the difference between `git merge` and `git pull`?**  
    - `git merge`: Merges another branch into your current branch  
    - `git pull`: Fetches and merges from the remote repository

14. **What happens internally when you run `git pull`?**  
    - Fetches latest changes  
    - Merges them into your local branch

15. **You made changes but forgot to stage them. What now?**  
    Run: `git add <filename>`

16. **Switch to a branch named `feature-login`:**  
    Run: `git checkout feature-login` or `git switch feature-login`

17. **Update your local repo if it's behind:**  
    Run: `git pull`

18. **Push committed changes to GitHub (main branch):**  
    Run: `git push origin main`

19. **Merge feature branch into main:**  
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge feature-branch
    ```

20. **Keep a clean, linear history (avoid merge commits):**  
    ```bash
    git checkout feature
    git rebase main
    ```
