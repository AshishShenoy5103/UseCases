| Q1  | What is the purpose of the SELECT statement?                         | To retrieve data from one or more tables.                              |
| Q2  | What does SELECT * mean?                                             | It selects all columns from the specified table(s).                    |
| Q3  | What is the difference between DISTINCT and ALL?                     | DISTINCT returns unique values; ALL (default) includes duplicates.     |
| Q4  | Can we use expressions in SELECT statements?                         | Yes, arithmetic and string operations are allowed.                     |
